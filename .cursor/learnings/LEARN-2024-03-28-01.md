# Development Flow: Handling Deferred Requirements

## Context
During implementation of the basic prompt endpoint, we deferred two requirements:
- Token limit validation
- Rate limiting

## Decision
- Created separate task for deferred items
- Kept original spec with clear marking of deferred items
- Documented rationale in task description

## Rationale
1. Simplicity First
   - Started with core functionality
   - Avoided premature optimization
   - Followed FastAPI conventions

2. Clear Tracking
   - Deferred items not forgotten
   - Explicit task creation
   - Maintained in specification

## Future Process
When deferring requirements:
1. Mark as deferred in original spec
2. Create new task for deferred items
3. Document decision in learnings
4. Consider dependencies for future implementation
