# Task Authoring Best Practices

## Context
When creating TASK-2024-03-XX-07, we initially included implementation details (code snippets) in the task description, which violated separation of concerns and proper task documentation principles.

## Key Insights

1. Task Content Boundaries
   - ‚úÖ SHOULD include:
     - Clear requirements
     - Testing requirements
     - Acceptance criteria
     - Dependencies and relationships
   - ‚ùå SHOULD NOT include:
     - Implementation code
     - Specific technical solutions
     - Design decisions
     - Implementation patterns

2. Level of Detail
   - Requirements should describe WHAT, not HOW
   - Testing requirements should focus on behaviors to verify
   - Acceptance criteria should be measurable and implementation-agnostic

3. Structure Pattern
   ```markdown
   # Task: [Descriptive Title]
   
   Status: üìù Open
   Priority: [Level]
   Related Spec: [Path to specification]
   
   ## Requirements
   [Grouped by feature/function, not implementation]
   
   ## Testing Requirements
   [Focus on what to verify, not how]
   
   ## Acceptance Criteria
   [Measurable outcomes]
   ```

## Recommendations for Rule Updates

The `development-workflow-rule.mdc` should be updated to include:

1. Task Content Guidelines
   - Clear separation between requirements and implementation
   - Focus on outcomes rather than solutions
   - Implementation-agnostic descriptions

2. Task Structure Template
   - Standardized sections
   - Guidelines for each section
   - Examples of good vs. bad task descriptions

3. Task Writing Principles
   - Write for clarity and understanding
   - Keep implementation details in development notes
   - Focus on verifiable outcomes
   - Maintain traceability to specifications

## Example Transformation

Bad Task Description:
```markdown
Add configuration:
```python
BATCH_SIZE: int = 10  # Default batch size
```
```

Good Task Description:
```markdown
Configuration Management:
- [ ] Add configurable batch size parameter
- [ ] Set default batch size to 10
- [ ] Ensure batch size is always positive
```

## Impact
- Clearer task boundaries
- Better separation of concerns
- More flexible implementation options
- Easier task tracking and verification
- Improved communication between specification and implementation

## Questions to Consider When Writing Tasks
1. Does this describe what needs to be done without prescribing how?
2. Are the requirements measurable and verifiable?
3. Could this be implemented in multiple ways while meeting the requirements?
4. Is it clear what "done" looks like?
```

Would you like me to:
1. Draft the specific updates needed for the `development-workflow-rule.mdc`?
2. Create a task template based on these learnings?
3. Revise our current task with any additional improvements based on these insights?

This learning experience shows how important it is to:
- Continuously refine our processes
- Learn from practical experience
- Update our rules based on real usage
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
