# Differentiating Specifications from Tasks

## Purpose & Scope
### Specifications
- Define WHAT the system should do
- Provide a long-term reference
- Focus on features and behaviors
- Define API contracts and interfaces
- Are product-focused
- May cover multiple implementation stages
- Should be implementation-agnostic

### Tasks
- Define HOW we'll implement the specification
- Represent immediate work items
- Focus on implementation steps
- Include testing requirements
- Are developer-focused
- Represent a single unit of work
- Can include implementation constraints

## Example Transformation

Current (Too Similar):
```markdown
Specification:
- Process prompts in configurable batch sizes
- Set default batch size to 10
- Add configuration endpoint for batch size

Task:
- Add configurable batch size parameter
- Set default batch size to 10
- Add configuration endpoint
```

Better:
```markdown
Specification:
### Batch Processing
The system must support processing of large prompt arrays by:
- Breaking requests into smaller batches
- Allowing configuration of batch sizes
- Maintaining response order
- Preserving partial results on errors

API Contract:
POST /api/v1/config/batch-size
{
    "size": integer
}

Task:
1. Implementation Steps
   - [ ] Add BatchConfig class for managing settings
   - [ ] Implement batch processing logic
   - [ ] Add configuration validation
   
2. Testing Requirements
   - [ ] Verify batch splitting logic
   - [ ] Test configuration updates
   - [ ] Validate error scenarios
```

## Recommendations
1. Specifications should:
   - Focus on system behavior
   - Define contracts and interfaces
   - Be stable and long-lasting
   - Serve as documentation

2. Tasks should:
   - Break down implementation work
   - Include specific testing needs
   - Be time-bound and actionable
   - Track progress
