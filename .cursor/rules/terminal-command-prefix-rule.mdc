# Rule: Enforce Consistent CWD for Terminal Commands

# This rule ensures that terminal commands executed via the AI
# always run from the project root directory (/home/jsnyde0/Documents/code/humble-clay/)
# to prevent path errors due to inconsistent shell states.

<rule>
name: enforce_terminal_cwd
filters:
  # Filter for when the run_terminal_cmd tool is about to be used.
  # This relies on the AI Assistant (me) recognizing the intent or the
  # Cursor rule system intercepting the tool call proposal.
  - type: tool_call
    pattern: "run_terminal_cmd"

actions:
  # React by providing instructions to the AI Assistant (me).

      # Prepend cd to project root before executing terminal command

      **RULE TRIGGERED: enforce_terminal_cwd**

      Before executing the proposed terminal command, I MUST ensure it is prefixed with:
      `cd /home/jsnyde0/Documents/code/humble-clay/ && `

      **Reason:** To guarantee command execution within the intended directory and ensure reliable path resolution, preventing errors observed previously.

      I will now modify the proposed command to include this prefix if it's missing.

  # Critical priority to ensure it's checked before every relevant command.
