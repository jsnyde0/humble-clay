# Multiple Prompts Processing

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Concurrent Processing
Core functionality:
- [ ] POST /api/v1/prompts endpoint
- [ ] Accept array of prompts
- [ ] Validate array size (max 1000)
- [ ] Process concurrently using asyncio.gather
- [ ] Return array of responses in same format as single prompt

Example Request:
```json
{
    "prompts": [
        "What is the capital of France?",
        "What is the capital of Italy?"
    ]
}
```

Example Response:
```json
{
    "responses": [
        {
            "response": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "status": "success"
        },
        {
            "response": "The capital of Italy is Rome.",
            "status": "success"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Stage 2: Batch Processing
Add batching:
- [ ] Add internal BATCH_SIZE variable (default: 10)
- [ ] Process prompts in batches
- [ ] Maintain overall response order
- [ ] Handle errors per batch
- [ ] Add configuration endpoint for batch size

### Stage 3: Rate Limiting
Add rate limiting:
- [ ] Add BATCH_DELAY variable (default: 100ms)
- [ ] Implement delay between batches
- [ ] Add configuration endpoint for delay
- [ ] Add basic monitoring (time per batch)
