# TASK-2023-07-11-01: Logging and Monitoring MVP

## Description
Implement logging and monitoring for the Humble Clay API, focusing specifically on the `/api/v1/prompts` endpoint which processes batches of prompts. This task will use Logfire's built-in FastAPI integration to provide visibility into request processing and batch operations with minimal custom code.

## Relevant Specifications
- [Log and Monitor Specification](./../specs/monitoring/log_and_monitor.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Logfire integration is set up and configured with the FastAPI application
- [x] The `/api/v1/prompts` endpoint logs batch processing progress
- [x] Timing metrics are captured for first result and overall completion
- [x] Sub-batch completion tracking is implemented
- [x] Error handling includes appropriate logging
- [ ] Logfire dashboards are configured to visualize the monitoring data

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Logfire integration:
   - [x] Install Logfire with FastAPI support
   - [x] Configure Logfire in the application
   - [x] Test basic request logging

2. Enhance batch endpoint:
   - [x] Add progress tracking to the `/prompts` endpoint
   - [x] Implement detailed logging of batch progress
   - [x] Add timing metrics for first and last results
   - [x] Track timing information for sub-batches

3. Configure dashboards:
   - [ ] Set up Logfire dashboards for request monitoring
   - [ ] Configure batch processing progress visualization
   - [ ] Create error rate monitoring dashboards

4. Test and validate:
   - [x] Test with various batch sizes
   - [x] Validate monitoring implementation with proper tests
   - [x] Ensure all progress is properly tracked
