# Task: Implement Basic Batch Processing

Status: üìù Open
Priority: High
Related Spec: specs/api/multiple_prompts.md (Stage 2)
Dependencies: None

## Implementation Goals
- Process large prompt arrays in smaller batches
- Keep it simple with fixed batch size

## Implementation Steps
1. Add Batch Processing
   - [ ] Add BATCH_SIZE constant (default: 10)
   - [ ] Split large requests into batches
   - [ ] Process batches concurrently
   - [ ] Maintain response order

2. Error Handling
   - [ ] Handle errors within batches
   - [ ] Preserve successful results
   - [ ] Keep existing error format

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test batch splitting works correctly
- [ ] Verify order preservation
- [ ] Test error handling per batch
- [ ] Integration test with real LLM

## Acceptance Criteria
- Large requests are processed in batches of 10
- Results maintain original order
- Errors in one batch don't affect others
- Matches existing response format
