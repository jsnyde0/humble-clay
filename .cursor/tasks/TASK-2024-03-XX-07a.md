# Task: Implement Basic Batch Processing

Status: âœ… Done
Started: 2024-03-28
Completed: 2024-03-28
Priority: High
Related Spec: specs/api/multiple_prompts.md (Stage 2)

## Implemented Features
1. Batch Processing
   - [x] Added BATCH_SIZE constant (10)
   - [x] Split large requests into batches
   - [x] Process batches concurrently
   - [x] Maintain response order

2. Error Handling
   - [x] Handle errors within batches
   - [x] Preserve successful results
   - [x] Keep existing error format

## Testing Coverage
- [x] Batch processing order verification
- [x] Error handling across batches
- [x] Integration test with real LLM
- [x] Order preservation verification

## Implementation Notes
- Kept implementation simple with fixed batch size
- Reused existing error handling patterns
- Maintained consistent response format
- Used asyncio.gather for concurrent processing

## Learnings
1. Simplicity First
   - Avoided over-engineering with configuration system
   - Fixed constants work well for initial implementation

2. Testing Precision
   - Important to be exact in error simulation
   - Mock functions need precise conditions
