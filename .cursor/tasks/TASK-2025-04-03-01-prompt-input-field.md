# TASK-2025-04-03-01: Prompt Input Field

## Description
Create a Prompt Input Field feature for the Humble Clay app that allows users to construct complex prompts with column references without using CONCATENATE formulas. This feature will be integrated directly into the main interface and provide a more intuitive way to create and manage AI prompts.

## Specifications
- [Prompt Input Field](../specs/ui/prompt_input_field.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Users can create multi-line prompts with column references using syntax like {A}, {B}
- [x] Users can specify target output column for results
- [x] Users can select which rows to process (specific range or all)
- [ ] Users can save prompt configurations with names
- [ ] Users can load previously saved configurations from a dropdown
- [x] Column references are correctly replaced with actual values when processing
- [x] Results are properly displayed in the specified output column

## Implementation Steps
1. [x] Add prompt editor textarea to the main interface
2. [x] Implement target output column selector
3. [x] Add row range selection inputs
4. [x] Develop backend processing to handle column references
5. [x] Integrate with existing API request functionality
6. [x] Add status indicators for processing
7. [ ] Create configuration name field and save functionality
8. [ ] Implement dropdown for loading saved configurations
9. [x] Test with various column references and row ranges

## Current Status
Stage 1 (Core UI and Processing) is complete. The interface is functional and can process prompts with column references. Initial testing revealed potential API response handling issues which have been addressed with improved error logging.

## Next Steps
Moving to Stage 2: Configuration Management
1. Add a text field for naming configurations
2. Implement save functionality to store configurations
3. Add a dropdown menu for loading saved configurations
4. Create backend storage for configurations
5. Test configuration save/load functionality

## Learnings
- Core UI implementation complete with successful integration of prompt processing
- Enhanced error logging added to help diagnose API response issues
- Current implementation successfully handles column references and row range selection
- Need to investigate API response handling for empty/error cases
